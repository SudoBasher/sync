To Do:

Add breadcrumb/logging to server & local workstations.

Ensure documentation of .ssh/config requirements.

Abort alternate port usage. Just use .ssh/config instead.

Add cloud server setup (make directories, assign directory privs, etc)

Add primary cloud server to redundant cloud server backups.

Add cron support.



Possibilities:

Instead of downloading to a different Storage-Download folder, prior to downloading, move current Storage upload folder to Storage-Old name, then download to Storage.

Separate syncing of system configs and storage into different, manually-activated processes? Flush this idea out a bit more. It sometimes I don't want to have the download process push the cloud hosts and .ssh configuration into my local machine.

Be able to use delete-delay for certain backups portions, but not others.
